## Static assets
Put images/videos under `public/media` and reference them as `/media/filename.ext`.

## Static page content

`npm run build` renders the homepage, pricing, and product components into HTML
using React's Node renderer. It does not require Chromium. Browser JavaScript
still mounts the same components for the calculator, navigation, and forms.
Blog and glossary pages retain their existing content prerendering.

The homepage is served through an exact Cloudflare Pages rewrite so the empty
`index.html` shell remains available for other client-side routes. This avoids
serving homepage text as the content of unrelated pages.

Run `npm test` to build the site and check page content, pricing facts, URL forms,
asset references, and signup attribution. Register additional pages in both
`scripts/prerender-pages.js` and `scripts/render-pages.jsx`.
