# Nobi AI

> Nobi is an AI sales associate for business websites. It turns any site into a place where visitors can ask questions, get real answers, and take action — powered by the business's own data.

## What Nobi Does

Nobi sits on a business's website and acts as a conversational sales associate. It understands what visitors mean (not just what they type), answers their questions in real time, and guides them toward the right products, services, or next steps.

### Core Capabilities

- **Semantic search**: Understands natural-language queries like "running shoes for wide feet under $120" and surfaces the right results instantly.
- **Conversational Q&A**: Answers product, sizing, shipping, and service questions without visitors needing to dig through pages or wait for support.
- **Product recommendations**: Suggests products based on the visitor's stated needs and intent.
- **Proactive engagement**: Suggestion pills, exit-intent prompts, and inline triggers keep visitors exploring instead of bouncing.
- **Flexible placement**: Search bar, PDP assistant, collection pages, modals, or triggered from any button via JS API.

### Verticals

Nobi started in ecommerce (Shopify and other platforms) and is expanding into automotive and other verticals. The platform generalizes to any business that wants an AI agent on its website.
